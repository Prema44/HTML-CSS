                        In this next live example, the flex container has align-items: flex-start, which means
                        the items are all aligned to the start of the cross axis. I have targeted the first item
                        using a first-child selector and set that item to align-self: stretch; another item has
                        been selected using its class of selected and given align-self: center. You can change 
                        the value of align-items or change the values of align-self on the individual items to 
                        see how this works.
                        </p>

                    <article class = "article2">
                        <h2>Second Article</h2>
                        <p>
                        So far we have been aligning the items, or an individual item inside the area defined by
                        the flex-container. If you have a wrapped multiple-line flex container then you might 
                        also want to use the align-content property to control the distribution of space between
                        the rows. In the specification this is described as packing flex lines.
